My MidBootcamp Project aims to answer the following questions based on exploration and data cleaning: 

1. Which have been the five OECD countries that received the highest inflow of immigrants every year during the last ten years? 

2. Which is the most common profile of the immigrants into the OECD countries considering gender and studies?

3. Which are the top five OECD countries that present the best laboral integration rates according to the educational attainment of the immigrant ?

4. Which are the top 5 OECD countries that have had the highest immigrants outflows  rates?  How are the nationality acquisition rates behaving?

5. Which are the 5 countries with the highest ratio of immigrant population to native population in the OECD? How are the nationality acquisition rates behaving?

Motivation

I am myself a traveler and an immigrant interested in the inflows and outflows of people from one place to the other. I found always fascinating the stories behind people, and how they got to their destination. I expect to clarify some interrogants that I have had for the last few years exploring and cleaning this data bases from the OECD.

Challenges

- The first challenge I found was the need to use three data bases in order all the questions. I could not find one containing all the relevant information.

- I could not merge or concatenate the three data bases, therefore I had to work with the three separetely in different notebooks.
